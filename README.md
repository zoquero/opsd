# Summary

**Operations Descriptor** is a tool to generate monitoring and documentation of a Project and its resources, usefull in datacenter operations if there's still not a CMDB.

Angel Galindo Mu√±oz ( zoquero@gmail.com ), November of 2018

# Features

In this release the input is an Excel file describing project, hosts, services, procedures, ... in a future release the input may be a relational database.

* It validates the input (an Excel file)
* It generates:
    * debugging information about itself
    * mediawiki code describing
        * inventory
        * procedures for incidents
        * procedures for requests
        * periodic operations
        * lifecycle operations for files
    * script to generate monitoring (it allows you to construct calls to custom commands "addHost" / "addService" of your own)

# Motivation

Poor monitoring or poor documentation provokes problems in datacenter operations without CMDB

* validation of the file
* warnings and errors
* mediawiki sources
* monitoring script
